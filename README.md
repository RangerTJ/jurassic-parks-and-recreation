# DINO: CS340 Project for Jurassic Parks and Recreation

Digital Information Nexus for Operations (DINO) is a database program used to simulate managing day to day operations at the various parks (canon or otherwise) from the Jurassic Park franchise. It is capable of handling basic CRUD operations for the following park entities:  
* Parks
* Facilities
* Biological Assets
* Employees
* Tasks Assigned
* Employee Tasks
* Species
* Diets
* Habitats
* Facility Types
* Job Classifications  
* Task Categories

Special thanks to Mark Hjorth for putting together the beautiful easter egg that we've linked to in a hidden spot on the website: https://github.com/MarkHjorth/nedry.  

Also, special thanks to Frontier studios, the developers behind the game Jurassic World Evolution 2, from which most of our simulated "photo" media has been derived.
